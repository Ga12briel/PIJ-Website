              <p>According to the Federal Police, the gang would be responsible for the largest deforestation ever recorded in the biome</p>

              <h5>Carolina Figueiredo, from CNN <br> In São Paulo</h5>
              <p>According to the PF, they are part of a criminal organization alongside a family of farmers. Two companies
              of land regularization were also targets, in addition to the office of a lawyer who would have privileged access to
              assessments and embargoes carried out by a federal environmental authority.</p>
              <p>The investigations identified that the companies, through their partners and employees, had defrauded registrations in
              public areas of the Union through the insertion of false data into systems and falsification of documents. The police Federal
              points out that employees also worked on planning and monitoring deforestation in real time.</p>
              <p>The aforementioned lawyer, who is one of the targets, is also being investigated for allegedly negotiating the payment of bribes to
              state public servants who allegedly caught illegal deforestation.</p>
              <p>In the decision authorizing the operation, the Federal Court of Pará decreed the kidnapping of approximately R$ 116 million and
              of nine properties in the group. In addition, it was determined that public servants and the attorney.</p>
              <p>In August of this year, the Federal Police launched the first phase of Operation Retomada. On that occasion, the PF arrested the businessman Bruno Heller, considered “the greatest devastator of the Amazon biome”. Three warrants were also served in
              search and seizure in the municipalities of Novo Progresso, in Pará, and in Sinop, in Mato Grosso. There was also the kidnapping of vehicles and around 20 properties, 11 of which were farms, in addition to the seizure of 10 thousand head of cattle.</p>

              <p>The agricultural sector, some parliamentarians and even the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, take a contrary
                position
                to the terms of the Mercosur-European Union agreement. The commercial treaty would change the dynamics of agriculture
                on the continent, which
                currently benefits the French.</p>
              <p>In the European bloc, the dynamics of agribusiness are governed by the Common Agricultural Policy (PAC) — which
                unifies rules for the
                sector in member countries. The set of standards includes market measures and subsidies for farmers.</p>
              <p>According to a CNN survey based on data from the European Commission, France is the main beneficiary of the CAP, both
                in direct payments to farmers and in spending on rural development on the continent.</p>
              <p>Between 2015 and 2021, French farmers received direct payments from the European Union the equivalent of R$262
                billion. This represents 18% of the block's total spend on this type of operation.</p>

              <p>Deforestation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region recorded a 59% drop in the first eight months of 2023,
                according to
                data from the new bulletin from the Deforestation Alert System (SAD) Atlantic Forest, released this Wednesday (29).
              </p>
              <p>Across the country, the area deforested between January and August this year was 9,216 hectares. In the same period
                last year
                there were 22,240 hectares. According to the SOS Mata Atlântica Foundation, Arcplan and MapBiomas — institutions that
                coordinate
                the platform — deforestation has already been on a downward trend since the beginning of the year. By May, the
                reduction was 42%.</p>
              <p>There is, however, a caveat regarding the area covered by the study: the SAD data only take into account the
                limits of the Atlantic Forest biome established by IBGE in 2019. In the area of application of the Atlantic Forest
                Law,
                enacted in 2006, which includes enclaves in the Caatinga and Cerrado, the decrease was 26% in the same period.</p>

              <h5>from CNN <br></h5>
              <p>In an interview with CNN this Tuesday (28), the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva, argued that Brazil will reach
              28th United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP 28) with “head held high” in view of the results in the climate

              <p>“Brazil, which took on a government, President Lula, of scorched earth, where environmental policies had been
                dismantled, Brazil was in a pariah condition and in 10 months it achieved this feat of reducing deforestation by
                48.9%,
                almost 50%”, said the minister.</p>
              <p>“People had a lot of doubts whether we would achieve this result, especially given that it was a situation that had
                a dismantling of environmental policy, structures, and also an increase in the nature of the problems that lead to
                deforestation: drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, illegal fishing, land grabbing, all these crimes. So Brazil,
                In this regard, he is holding his head high, knowing that our commitment is zero deforestation by 2030”, he added.</p>

                Thursday (9). The balance covers the period between August 2022 and July this year, part of the Jair Bolsonaro

              <p>The forest, however, has suffered in recent months with a wave of fires, particularly in the Amazon region, where

              <p>In total, 9,001 km² were deforested in the biome in these 12 months, according to consolidated data from the
                Monitoring of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon by Satellite (Prodes), from the National Institute for Space Research
                (Inpe), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. The loss of vegetation cover is mapped using
                satellites and the deforestation rate is always counted from August of one year to July of the following year.</p>
